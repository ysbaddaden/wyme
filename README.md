= WYME

WYME stands for What You Mean Editor. It's not supposed to be a WYSIWYG
editor, thought it actually looks like one as it stands.

WYME is library agnostic, and should be working as is on modern browsers.
For older browsers like Internet Explorer 8 and below, AlphaCore is
required. See http://github.com/ysbaddaden/alpha-core
