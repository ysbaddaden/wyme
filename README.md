= Wyme

Wyme stands for What You Mean Editor. It's not supposed to be a WYSIWYG
editor, thought it looks like one for now.

Wyme requires the AlphaControl library and should be working in any modern
browsers, thought it shall certainly fail in Internet Explorer 8 and below,
until I --or someone-- fixes it.

You may get AlphaCore and AlphaControl at:
